My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Spoilers ahead! Also expect some nasty code and crazy bad solutions. There's at

- 2016 - My first year, using Ruby since that's what I used at work
- 2018
- 2019
- 2020 - Decided to use Go, to get better at it
- 2024 - Decided to use this as an exucse to learn Rust
