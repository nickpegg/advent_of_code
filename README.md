My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Spoilers ahead! Also expect some nasty code and crazy bad solutions. There's at
least one case where I was totally barking up the wrong tree for a solution.

- 2016 - My first year, using Ruby since that's what I used at work
- 2018
- 2019
- 2020 - Decided to use Go, to get better at it
- 2023 - Apparently I couldn't be arsed to get very far. Stressful year at
         work, probably didn't feel like coding much at home.
- 2024 - Decided to use this as an exucse to learn Rust
